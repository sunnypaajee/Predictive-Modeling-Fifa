⚽ FIFA 23 Player Analysis & Position Prediction
📌 Problem Statement

Football clubs want to leverage Data Analysis and Machine Learning to gain insights into players’ skills and performance. This project helps club management to:

Identify essential skills required in their players.

Understand competitor clubs and their top-performing players.

Place players in their most suitable positions.

Group similar players together to build a balanced and efficient squad.

📊 Dataset

The dataset contains player data from FIFA 23, including:

Player Attributes: Attacking, Skills, Defense, Mentality, Goalkeeping, etc.

Performance Data: Best position, roles in club and national teams.

Personal Data: Nationality, Club, Date of Birth, Wage, Salary, Value, etc.

🎯 Objectives

Identify the best players across different clubs.

Understand the strengths of competitor clubs.

Determine the key skills necessary for high performance.

Recommend the most suitable position for each player.

Group club players into clusters based on similarities.

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key questions explored:

Does a player’s age affect ball control?

How does height impact stamina, dribbling, pace, passing, and heading accuracy?

Is there a relationship between a player’s wage and overall rating?

Who are the fastest players?

How are position, wage, and value related?

Which nationalities have the highest-paid players?

What is the effect of age on player potential?

Who are the Top 50 players and what clubs do they belong to?

🛠️ Data Preprocessing
